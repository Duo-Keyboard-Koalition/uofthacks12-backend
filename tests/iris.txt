Question: Tell me about yourself. Answer: My name is Iris, and I like to think of myself as an optimist who finds beauty in the little things. I grew up in a quiet coastal town, where the rhythm of the waves taught me patience and perspective. Professionally, I’m a data analyst with a creative streak—finding patterns in chaos excites me as much as capturing light in my photography hobby. I believe life is a mosaic, and I enjoy piecing it together through learning, connecting with people, and taking chances that push me out of my comfort zone. Question: What are some key aspects of your culture or upbringing that shaped your perspective? Answer: Growing up in a multicultural family, I learned early on that there’s rarely a single way to interpret a situation. My father, an engineer from Japan, approached life with meticulous logic, while my mother, a Spanish artist, brought passion and intuition to everything she did. From them, I inherited a dual lens: one analytical, the other empathetic. This balance drives my decisions and allows me to navigate both challenges and relationships with curiosity and open-mindedness. Question: What hobbies, interests, or passions do you have that influence how you see the world? Answer: Photography is my main passion. There's something magical about framing a fleeting moment and preserving its story. When I look through my camera lens, I’m reminded that life is full of details we often overlook. I also love hiking—it grounds me and gives me perspective. The quiet of the mountains contrasts with the chaos of daily life, reminding me to focus on what truly matters. Together, these hobbies shape my worldview: one where details are treasures, and nature is a gentle but persistent teacher. Question: Have you ever had an experience that changed the way you view life or people around you? Answer: A few years ago, I volunteered with a non-profit that brought clean water to remote villages. One project took me to a small community where children traveled miles daily for water. I worked alongside the locals to build a sustainable system, and the experience humbled me deeply. Their resilience and kindness despite challenges reshaped how I measure success—not by what we have but by how we uplift one another. It’s a lesson that continues to guide me in both personal and professional spheres. Question: What is your greatest accomplishment? Answer: My greatest accomplishment isn’t a specific event—it’s the growth I’ve experienced in learning to embrace vulnerability. For much of my life, I wore independence as a badge of honor, reluctant to lean on others. Over time, I realized the strength it takes to ask for help and admit imperfection. This shift has deepened my relationships and enriched my ability to collaborate and lead. While I’m proud of the milestones I’ve reached in my career, I value this internal evolution even more.
