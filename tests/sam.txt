Question: Tell me about yourself. Answer: My name is Sam, and I’d describe myself as a thinker with a practical streak. I’ve always been fascinated by systems—how things work, whether it’s a piece of technology, an organization, or even human behavior. I studied computer science but have a knack for connecting dots beyond just the technical realm. I’m a problem-solver at heart, always looking for efficient ways to improve processes or create solutions. Outside of work, I enjoy tinkering with DIY projects, which gives me a hands-on outlet for my curiosity.   Question: What are some key aspects of your culture or upbringing that shaped your perspective? Answer: I grew up in a family that valued pragmatism and hard work. My parents were small business owners, and watching them tackle challenges daily taught me resilience and resourcefulness. They didn’t sugarcoat the realities of life, and that honesty shaped me into someone who values practicality and clear thinking. At the same time, they encouraged me to dream big and explore, which gave me the confidence to approach challenges with both ambition and a grounded perspective.   Question: What hobbies, interests, or passions do you have that influence how you see the world? Answer: I’m passionate about woodworking, and I think it’s because it’s the perfect blend of creativity and logic. Designing and building something from scratch requires precision and a vision, which parallels how I approach problem-solving in life. I’m also an avid chess player, which has trained me to think ahead and consider multiple perspectives. Both hobbies have taught me the importance of patience, strategy, and the satisfaction that comes from crafting something well.   Question: Have you ever had an experience that changed the way you view life or people around you? Answer: One experience that stands out is when I worked with a team to rebuild a community center after a hurricane. I went in thinking it was just about restoring a building, but I quickly realized it was about restoring a sense of normalcy and hope for the people there. The way the community came together, supporting each other through the process, showed me how powerful collective effort can be. It shifted my focus from individual achievements to the impact of collaboration.   Question: What is your greatest accomplishment? Answer: My greatest accomplishment is designing and building a custom app for a local non-profit that streamlined their donation tracking process. They’d been using a clunky system that wasted hours of their time, and I was able to create something that saved them significant resources. Seeing my work make a tangible difference for a cause I cared about was incredibly rewarding, and it reinforced my belief in technology as a tool for meaningful change.
