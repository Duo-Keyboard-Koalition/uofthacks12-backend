Question: Tell me about yourself. Answer: I’m Alex, someone who thrives on adventure and discovery. Whether it’s tackling a challenging project at work or exploring new hiking trails, I’m always looking for ways to push boundaries. I work as a product manager, and I love bringing ideas to life and helping teams collaborate effectively. Outside of work, I’m a bit of a thrill-seeker—I’ve skydived, tried scuba diving, and even taken a crack at stand-up comedy. Life’s too short to play it safe, and I try to bring that energy to everything I do.   Question: What are some key aspects of your culture or upbringing that shaped your perspective? Answer: I grew up in a military family, which meant moving around a lot and learning to adapt quickly. Each new place had its own culture, people, and challenges, and I learned to see change not as something to fear but as an opportunity to grow. This upbringing taught me resilience and the importance of building connections wherever you go. It also instilled in me a love for diversity and the ability to thrive in dynamic environments.   Question: What hobbies, interests, or passions do you have that influence how you see the world? Answer: I’m passionate about rock climbing, and it’s had a huge influence on how I approach challenges. Climbing teaches you to assess risks, trust your instincts, and stay calm under pressure. It’s also a reminder that progress doesn’t always come in big leaps—sometimes it’s just finding the next foothold. I also love photography, especially when I travel, because it helps me see the beauty in everyday moments and different perspectives.   Question: Have you ever had an experience that changed the way you view life or people around you? Answer: A few years ago, I backpacked solo through Southeast Asia for two months. Being on my own in unfamiliar places pushed me out of my comfort zone and forced me to rely on strangers for help. What amazed me was the kindness and generosity of people, even when we didn’t speak the same language. That trip taught me that people are fundamentally good and that stepping into the unknown can lead to some of the most rewarding experiences.   Question: What is your greatest accomplishment? Answer: My greatest accomplishment is completing my first marathon. I’m not a natural runner, and the training was grueling, both physically and mentally. There were moments when I wanted to quit, but crossing that finish line was a powerful reminder of what’s possible when you set a goal and stick to it. It wasn’t just about the race—it was about proving to myself that I could overcome challenges and push through discomfort to achieve something meaningful.
